This is a visualization I am trying to do with video game satles dataset. It has around 60000 data in them. I am trying to visualize this in the best way. 

I will be trying to do the visualization as it progresses. 

For starting I wanted the sunbrst chart with which a data can be shown with respect to consoles.

Then by year and video game names

I will try to incorporate all the data in the best way possible
